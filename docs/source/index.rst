Welcome to Polytope's documentation!
====================================

**Polytope** is a weather data provisioning service for cloud, developed as part of the EU projects `LEXIS <https://lexis-project.eu/web/>`_ and `HiDALGO <https://hidalgo-project.eu/>`_. The data service is exposed via a HTTP REST API, which allows to submit requests and query their status until the data is available for downloading.

**polytope-client** is a Python library for user-friendly interaction with the REST API from Python scripts or sessions. Additionally, it includes a command-line client tool.

.. note::

   The LEXIS and HiDALGO projects have received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No. 825532 and No. 824115.
